THIS AIN'T NO GAME, well... it is..... NOW!

Experience and play through the highest grossing animated movie of 2023 in an all new epic way through an action packed retro story driven 2D Platformer! When struggling & failing Brooklyn plumbers who are brothers and best friends, Mario and Luigi, resolve to fix a water main after a mysterious disastrous flood occurs, the two get separated and end up in a parallel world known as Planet Nin. While Mario ends up in the wonderful Mushroom Kingdom ruled by the kind-hearted Princess Peach Toadstool and is home to the Toad Species, Luigi ends up in the evil King of the Koopas domain named the Darklands. The King, Bowser. with his wizardly adviser and father figure, Kamek, and his council, the Elite Trio (Who bicker over who deserves to be promoted to Emperor), plan to rule both Earth and Nin at once, marry Princess Peach and collect all 6 Power stars to gain unlimited power. Mario, Peach and one of the Peach's brave subjects named Toad/Kinopio, team up to save Luigi, collect the power stars and recruit an army and stop Bowser's plans, while tapping into the powers they never knew they had in them.
